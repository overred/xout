# :pencil: XOut Logger
> XOut - Multi-Target Logger with Individual Customization for Each Target.

Use colored terminal to log All events. Use syslog to log Error events. Use database to log Trace&Debug events. Use file to log Info events. Use **All of It simultaneously** with different formatters and log levels for each!

## :star: Features
- :rainbow: Color output with formatting tags
  (thanks to [@inhere] with [gookit/color]).
- :window: Color output for Windows (thanks to [@mattn] with [go-colorable]).
- :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Multiple output targets with customization for each.
- :gear: Built-in output formatters inspired by [logrus] and [zerolog].
- :books: Built-in loggers presets for different scenarios.
- :construction: ~~Fast configuration from config file.~~

## :abacus: <span id="reasons">Yet Another Logger?</span>
Yes. But, I would like a very simple like [logrus], pretty fast like [zap] and [zerolog], and flexible and convenient logger.

With a simple setup for rapid prototyping. With the ability to output the log to several places at once (DB, file, syslog and terminal) with a specific level of logging and format for each. In addition, I would like cross-platform with color text support for the Windows console and convenient tag-based text formatting.

That's it.

#### Default Built-In Logger
The simples way to start with Default logger.
It's as simple as:
```go
xout.Info("Info log level!")
xout.Infof("Formatting Like %s", "fmt.Printf")
xout.Infof("And <fg=cyan>formatting tags</> support!")
```
